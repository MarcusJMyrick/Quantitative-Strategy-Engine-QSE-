A high-performance, event-driven backtesting engine in C++ with a Python analysis layer, designed to develop and evaluate quantitative trading strategies.

## About The Project

This project was built as a comprehensive portfolio piece to demonstrate the key skills required for a Quantitative Developer role. It simulates a professional trading environment by separating the high-performance C++ core from the flexible Python research layer.

The core architecture consists of:
* **A C++ Core Engine:** For low-latency event processing, strategy execution, and order management.
* **A Python Data Pipeline:** For acquiring, cleaning, and storing market data efficiently.
* **A Python Analysis Suite:** (Future Work) To analyze the results generated by the C++ engine, calculating key performance metrics and creating visualizations.

## Key Features

* **High-Performance C++ Core:** An event-driven backtester designed for speed.
* **Efficient Data Handling:** Uses Apache Arrow and the Parquet columnar format for fast data I/O between Python and C++.
* **Test-Driven Development:** Includes separate, robust unit test suites for both Python (`pytest`) and C++ (`Google Test`).
* **Modular Design:** Decouples components using interfaces (`IDataReader`, `IStrategy`) to allow for easy testing and extension.
* **End-to-End Simulation:** Capable of running a complete backtest, from loading data to executing a strategy and tracking positions.

## Technology Stack

### C++ Core Engine
* **C++17**
* **CMake**: For cross-platform build automation.
* **Apache Arrow / Parquet**: For high-performance, columnar data I/O.
* **Google Test**: For C++ unit testing.

### Python Environment
* **Python 3.8+**
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **PyArrow**: For working with the Parquet file format.
* **Pytest**: For Python unit testing.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Git
* A C++17 compliant compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
* CMake (version 3.14 or higher)
* Python (version 3.8 or higher)
* Apache Arrow and Parquet C++ libraries installed (e.g., via `brew` or `vcpkg`)

### Installation & Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/MarcusJMyrick/Quantitative-Strategy-Engine-QSE-.git](https://github.com/MarcusJMyrick/Quantitative-Strategy-Engine-QSE-.git)
    cd Quantitative-Strategy-Engine-QSE-
    ```

2.  **Set up the Python environment:**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Generate Test Data:**
    The C++ tests require a sample data file. Generate it using the Python script.
    ```sh
    python3 tests/create_test_data.py
    ```

4.  **Configure and Build the C++ Project:**
    Use the provided build script, which runs CMake and Make.
    ```sh
    ./build.sh
    ```
    This will compile the `qse` library, the `run_tests` executable, and the main `qse_app` executable inside the `build/` directory.

## Usage Workflow

1.  **Run the Backtest Simulation:**
    Execute the main C++ application to run the simulation with the hard-coded `SimpleStrategy`.
    ```sh
    ./build/qse_app
    ```
    You should see output confirming the start and finish of the backtest, along with any trade executions.

2.  **(Future Work) Analyze Results:**
    The next step is to have `qse_app` write its results to a `.csv` file, which can then be analyzed.
    ```sh
    python3 scripts/analyze.py
    ```

## Testing

This project contains two separate test suites.

1.  **To run the C++ unit tests:**
    The `build.sh` script runs the tests automatically via CTest after building. To run them manually:
    ```sh
    cd build
    ctest --verbose
    cd ..
    ```

2.  **To run the Python unit tests:**
    ```sh
    pytest
    ```
